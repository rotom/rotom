<h2>Selectional properties of attitude predicates</h2>

<p>Some attitude predicates may take interrogative complements, others declarative complements, and some both. Notably, this pattern is relatively cross-linguistically stable: a verb like <i>think</i>, for example, tends to embed only declaratives, be it in English, Estonian, or Japanese. This project aims to understand <b>how</b> the embedding behavior of an attitude predicate may be derived from its lexical semantics. Currently, I am investigating the <i>can't believe</i> construction, notable because it is factive, unlike any of its constituent parts. Previously, I argued the Estonian responsive verb <i>mõtlema</i> 'think, contemplate' is incompatible with a proposition-embedding semantics, with implications for the selectional behavior of responsive predicates more generally.</p>

<h2>The interpretation of negative polar questions in Estonian</h2>

<p>Across languages, polar questions with negation are consistently interpreted differently than those without. But why does negation <i>per se</i> have that effect, and how can we characterize the use ? I am experimentally investigating these questions in Estonian, an ideal language to test hypotheses about negation because negative questions in Estonian have different discourse effects depending on the question particle used. I suggest that the discourse effects of negative questions may be derived from general pragmatic preference for aligning the polarity of a question with that of a hearer's expected response. Current work also probes the role of evidentiality in question formation.</p>

<h2 style="display: inline;">Discourse Particles and Uncontroversiality</h2><br />
<i>Joint work with <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~makroll">Margaret Kroll</a></i>

<p>We are studying the semantic and pragmatic effects of discourse markers of 'uncontroversiality' like <i>of course</i> in English, or <i>kyll(ä)/küll</i> in Finnish/Estonian.  Such speaker-oriented adverbs may be used to respond to assertions and questions with a surprising array of interpretations; we argue this follows naturally from their semantics and an account that derives bare adverbial responses elliptically.</p>

<h2 style="display: inline;">Prosody and verbatim memory</h2><br />
<i>Joint work with <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~jbellik">Jennifer Bellik</a></i><br />

<p>Much research on verbatim memory for language focuses on lexical or syntactic features, while comparatively little has been done on how we represent prosody in memory. Is prosody remembered differently if it contributes a semantic or pragmatic function (like focal pitch accent) or if it is purely phonologically conditioned (like the rhythm rule)? Preliminary results suggest that there is at least some memory for prosody as a purely abstract feature.</p>

<h2 style="display: inline;">The psychology of fake news</h2><br />
<i>Joint work with <a href="https://allisongnguyen.wordpress.com/">Allison Nguyen</a>, <a href="https://foxtree.sites.ucsc.edu/jean-e-fox-tree/">Jean E. Fox Tree</a>, and <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~panand">Pranav Anand</a></i>

<p>The current proliferation of fake and hyperpartisan news has serious political and social ramifications. This cross-discipline collaboration aims to understand what it is that makes fake news appealing. How do fake news creators exploit people's real psychological tendencies? What psychological needs does fake news fulfill? We aim to understand these questions in order to develop pedagogical tools to help people better confront their own biases and inoculate themselves against fake news.</p>
